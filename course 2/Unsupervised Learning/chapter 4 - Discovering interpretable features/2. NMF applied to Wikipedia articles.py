'''
In the video, you saw NMF applied to transform a toy word-frequency array. 
Now it's your turn to apply NMF, this time using the tf-idf word-frequency array of Wikipedia articles, given as a csr matrix articles. 
Here, fit the model and transform the articles. In the next exercise, you'll explore the result.
'''

# Import NMF
from sklearn.decomposition import NMF

# Create an NMF instance: model
model = NMF(n_components=6)

# Fit the model to articles
model.fit(articles)

# Transform the articles: nmf_features
nmf_features = model.transform(articles)

# Print the NMF features
print(nmf_features.round(2))
