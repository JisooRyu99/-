'''
While eye-balling differences is a useful way to gain an intuition for the data, let's see if you can operationalize things with a model. In this exercise, you will use each repetition as a datapoint, and each moment in time as a feature to fit a classifier that attempts to predict abnormal vs. normal heartbeats using only the raw data.

We've split the two DataFrames (normal and abnormal) into X_train, X_test, y_train, and y_test.

from sklearn.svm import LinearSVC

# Initialize and fit the model
model = LinearSVC()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Generate predictions and score them manually
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
print(sum(predictions == y_test.squeeze()) / len(y_test))
