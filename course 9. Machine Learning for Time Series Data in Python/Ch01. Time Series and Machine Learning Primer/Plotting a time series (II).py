'''
You'll now plot both the datasets again, but with the included time stamps for each (stored in the column called "time"). Let's see if this gives you some more context for understanding each time series data.

# Plot the time series in each dataset
fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize=(5, 10))
data.iloc[:1000].plot(x='time', y='data_values', ax=axs[0])
data2.iloc[:1000].plot(x='time', y='data_values', ax=axs[1])
plt.show()
