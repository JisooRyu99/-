'''
Now that you've practiced some simple feature engineering, let's move on to something more complex. You'll calculate a collection of features for your time series data and visualize what they look like over time. This process resembles how many other time series models operate.

# Define a rolling window with Pandas, excluding the right-most datapoint of the window
prices_perc_rolling = prices_perc.rolling(20, min_periods=5, closed='right')

# Define the features you'll calculate for each window
features_to_calculate = [np.min, np.max, np.mean, np.std]

# Calculate these features for your rolling window object
features = prices_perc_rolling.agg(features_to_calculate)

# Plot the results
ax = features.loc[:"2011-01"].plot()
prices_perc.loc[:"2011-01"].plot(ax=ax, color='k', alpha=.2, lw=3)
ax.legend(loc=(1.01, .6))
plt.show()
