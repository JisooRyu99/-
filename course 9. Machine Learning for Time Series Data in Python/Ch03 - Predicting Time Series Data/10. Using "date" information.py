'''
It's easy to think of timestamps as pure numbers, but don't forget they generally correspond to things that happen in the real world. That means there's often extra information encoded in the data such as "is it a weekday?" or "is it a holiday?". This information is often useful in predicting timeseries data.

In this exercise, you'll extract these date/time based features. A single time series has been loaded in a variable called prices.
'''

# Extract date features from the data, add them as columns
prices_perc['day_of_week'] = prices_perc.index.dayofweek
prices_perc['week_of_year'] = prices_perc.index.weekofyear
prices_perc['month_of_year'] = prices_perc.index.month

# Print prices_perc
print(prices_perc)
