'''
Now that you've fit the model, let's visualize its coefficients. This is an important part of machine learning because it gives you an idea for how the different features of a model affect the outcome.

The shifted time series DataFrame (prices_perc_shifted) and the regression model (model) are available in your workspace.

In this exercise, you will create a function that, given a set of coefficients and feature names, visualizes the coefficient values.

def visualize_coefficients(coefs, names, ax):
    # Make a bar plot for the coefficients, including their names on the x-axis
    ax.bar(names, coefs)
    ax.set(xlabel='Coefficient name', ylabel='Coefficient value')
    
    # Set formatting so it looks nice
    plt.setp(ax.get_xticklabels(), rotation=45, horizontalalignment='right')
    return ax
    


# Visualize the output data up to "2011-01"
fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize=(10, 5))
y.loc[:'2011-01'].plot(ax=axs[0])

# Run the function to visualize model's coefficients
visualize_coefficients(model.coef_, prices_perc_shifted.columns, ax=axs[1])
plt.show()
