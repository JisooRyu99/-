'''
It's time to piece together all of the transforms along with an XGBClassifier to build the full pipeline!

Besides the numeric_categorical_union that you created in the previous exercise, there are two other transforms needed: the Dictifier() transform which we created for you, and the DictVectorizer().

After creating the pipeline, your task is to cross-validate it to see how well it performs.
'''

# Create full pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline([
                     ("featureunion", numeric_categorical_union),
                     ("dictifier", Dictifier()),
                     ("vectorizer", DictVectorizer(sort=False)),
                     ("clf", xgb.XGBClassifier(max_depth=3))
                    ])

# Perform cross-validation
cross_val_scores = cross_val_score(pipeline, X, y, scoring="roc_auc", cv=3)

# Print avg. AUC
print("3-fold AUC: ", np.mean(cross_val_scores))
