Now that you've used trees as base models in XGBoost, let's use the other kind of base model that can be used with XGBoost - a linear learner. This model, although not as commonly used in XGBoost, allows you to create a regularized linear regression using XGBoost's powerful learning API. However, because it's uncommon, you have to use XGBoost's own non-scikit-learn compatible functions to build the model, such as xgb.train().

In order to do this you must create the parameter dictionary that describes the kind of booster you want to use (similarly to how you created the dictionary in Chapter 1 when you used xgb.cv()). The key-value pair that defines the booster type (base model) you need is "booster":"gblinear".

Once you've created the model, you can use the .train() and .predict() methods of the model just like you've done in the past.

Here, the data has already been split into training and testing sets, so you can dive right into creating the DMatrix objects required by the XGBoost learning API.

# Convert the training and testing sets into DMatrixes: DM_train, DM_test
DM_train = xgb.DMatrix(data=X_train, label=y_train)
DM_test =  xgb.DMatrix(data=X_test, label=y_test)

# Create the parameter dictionary: params
params = {"booster":"gblinear", "objective":"reg:linear"}

# Train the model: xg_reg
xg_reg = xgb.train(params = params, dtrain=DM_train, num_boost_round=5)

# Predict the labels of the test set: preds
preds = xg_reg.predict(DM_test)

# Compute and print the RMSE
rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test,preds))
print("RMSE: %f" % (rmse))
