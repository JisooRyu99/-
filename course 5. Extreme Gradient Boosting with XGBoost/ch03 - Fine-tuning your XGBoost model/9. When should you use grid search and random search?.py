Now that you've seen some of the drawbacks of grid search and random search, which of the following most accurately describes why both random search and grid search are non-ideal search hyperparameter tuning strategies in all scenarios?

Possible Answers = 3

1. Grid Search and Random Search both take a very long time to perform, regardless of the number of parameters you want to tune.

2. Grid Search and Random Search both scale exponentially in the number of hyperparameters you want to tune.

3. The search space size can be massive for Grid Search in certain cases, whereas for Random Search the number of hyperparameters has a significant effect on how long it takes to run.

4. Grid Search and Random Search require that you have some idea of where the ideal values for hyperparameters reside.
