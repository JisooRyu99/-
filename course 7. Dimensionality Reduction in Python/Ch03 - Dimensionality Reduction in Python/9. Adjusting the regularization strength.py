'''
Your current Lasso model has an  score of 84.7%. When a model applies overly powerful regularization it can suffer from high bias, hurting its predictive power.

Let's improve the balance between predictive power and model simplicity by tweaking the alpha parameter.
'''

# Find the highest alpha value with R-squared above 98%
la = Lasso(alpha=0.1, random_state=0)

# Fits the model and calculates performance stats
la.fit(X_train_std, y_train)
r_squared = la.score(X_test_std, y_test)
n_ignored_features = sum(la.coef_ == 0)

# Print peformance stats 
print("The model can predict {0:.1%} of the variance in the test set.".format(r_squared))
print("{} out of {} features were ignored.".format(n_ignored_features, len(la.coef_)))


'''
<script.py> output:
    The model can predict 98.3% of the variance in the test set.
    64 out of 91 features were ignored.
