What advantage does feature selection have over feature extraction?

Possible Answers = 3

1. Feature selection allows you to do a stronger reduction in the number of dimensions.

2. Less information is lost during feature selection compared to feature extraction.

3. The selected features remain unchanged, and are therefore easy to interpret.

4. Models will never overfit to a sub-selected dataset.
