'''
Time to look at the results of your hard work. In this exercise, you will visualize the output of t-SNE dimensionality reduction on the combined male and female Ansur dataset. You'll create 3 scatterplots of the 2 t-SNE features ('x' and 'y') which were added to the dataset df. In each scatterplot you'll color the points according to a different categorical variable.

seaborn has already been imported as sns and matplotlib.pyplot as plt.

# Color the points according to Army Component
sns.scatterplot(x="x", y="y", hue='Component', data=df)
 
# Show the plot
plt.show()

# Color the points by Army Branch
sns.scatterplot(x="x", y="y", hue='Branch', data=df)

# Show the plot
plt.show()

# Color the points by Gender
sns.scatterplot(x="x", y="y", hue='Gender', data=df)

# Show the plot
plt.show()
