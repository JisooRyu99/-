You want to compare prices for specific products between stores. The features in the pre-loaded dataset sales_df are: storeID, product, quantity and revenue. The quantity and revenue features tell you how many items of a particular product were sold in a store and what the total revenue was. For the purpose of your analysis it's more interesting to know the average price per product.
'''

# Calculate the price from the quantity sold and revenue
sales_df['price'] = sales_df['revenue'] / sales_df['quantity']

# Drop the quantity and revenue features
reduced_df = sales_df.drop(['revenue', 'quantity'], axis=1)

print(reduced_df.head())
