After standardizing the lower and upper arm lengths from the ANSUR dataset we've added two perpendicular vectors that are aligned with the main directions of variance. 
We can describe each point in the dataset as a combination of these two vectors multiplied with a value each. 
These values are then called principal components.




Which of the following statements is true?

Possible Answers = 1

1. People with a negative component for the yellow vector have long forearms relative to their upper arms.

2. People with a positive component for the yellow vector have long forearms relative to their upper arms.

3. People with a negative component for the red vector have above average arm lengths.

4. People with a positive component for the red vector have below average arm lengths.
