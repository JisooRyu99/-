'''
We have loaded the following image using the imread() function of the image class of matplotlib.

The RGB values are stored in a DataFrame, batman_df. The RGB values have been standardized used the whiten() function, stored in columns, scaled_red, scaled_blue and scaled_green.

Construct an elbow plot with the DataFrame. How many dominant colors are present?

distortions = []
num_clusters = range(1, 7)

# Create a list of distortions from the kmeans function
for i in num_clusters:
    cluster_centers, distortion = kmeans(batman_df[['scaled_red','scaled_blue','scaled_green']],i)
    distortions.append(distortion)

# Create a DataFrame with two lists, num_clusters and distortions
