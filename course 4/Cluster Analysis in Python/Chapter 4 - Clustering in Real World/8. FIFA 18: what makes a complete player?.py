'''
In this exercise, you will use all six characteristics to create clusters. The data for this exercise is stored in a pandas DataFrame, fifa. features is the list of these column names and scaled_features is the list of columns which contains their scaled values. The following have been pre-loaded: kmeans, vq from scipy.cluster.vq, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, seaborn as sns.

Before you start the exercise, you may wish to explore scaled_features in the IPython Shell to check out the list of six scaled columns names.

# Create centroids with kmeans for 2 clusters
cluster_centers,_ = kmeans(fifa[scaled_features], 2)

# Assign cluster labels and print cluster centers
fifa['cluster_labels'], _ = vq(fifa[scaled_features], cluster_centers)
print(fifa.groupby('cluster_labels')[scaled_features].mean())

# Plot cluster centers to visualize clusters
fifa.groupby('cluster_labels')[scaled_features].mean().plot(legend=True, kind='bar')
plt.show()

# Get the name column of first 5 players in each cluster
for cluster in fifa['cluster_labels'].unique():
    print(cluster, fifa[fifa['cluster_labels'] == cluster]['name'].values[:5])
