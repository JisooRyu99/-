'''
In the earlier exercise, you constructed an elbow plot on data with well-defined clusters. Let us now see how the elbow plot looks on a data set with uniformly distributed points. You may want to display the data points in the IPython Shell before proceeding with the exercise.

The data is stored in a pandas DataFrame, uniform_data. x_scaled and y_scaled are the column names of the standardized X and Y coordinates of points.
'''

distortions = []
num_clusters = range(2, 7)

# Create a list of distortions from the kmeans function
for i in num_clusters:
    cluster_centers, distortion = kmeans(uniform_data[['x_scaled','y_scaled']],i)
    distortions.append(distortion)

# Create a DataFrame with two lists - number of clusters and distortions
elbow_plot = pd.DataFrame({'num_clusters': num_clusters, 'distortions': distortions})

# Creat a line plot of num_clusters and distortions
sns.lineplot(x='num_clusters', y='distortions', data=elbow_plot)
plt.xticks(num_clusters)
plt.show()
