'''
Let us now visualize the footfall dataset from Comic Con using the seaborn module. Visualizing clusters using seaborn is easier with the inbuild hue function for cluster labels.

The data is stored in a pandas DataFrame, comic_con. x_scaled and y_scaled are the column names of the standardized X and Y coordinates of people at a given point in time. cluster_labels has the cluster labels. A linkage object is stored in the variable distance_matrix.

# Import the seaborn module
import seaborn as sns

# Plot a scatter plot using seaborn
sns.scatterplot(x='x_scaled', 
                y='y_scaled', 
                hue='cluster_labels', 
                data = comic_con)
plt.show()
