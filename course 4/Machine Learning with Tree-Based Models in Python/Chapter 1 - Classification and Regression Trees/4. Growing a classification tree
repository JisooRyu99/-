Growing a classification tree
In the video, you saw that the growth of an unconstrained classification tree followed a few simple rules. Which of the following is not one of these rules?

answer = 4

1. The existence of a node depends on the state of its predecessors.

2. The impurity of a node can be determined using different criteria such as entropy and the gini-index.

3. When the information gain resulting from splitting a node is null, the node is declared as a leaf.

4. When an internal node is split, the split is performed in such a way so that information gain is minimized.
