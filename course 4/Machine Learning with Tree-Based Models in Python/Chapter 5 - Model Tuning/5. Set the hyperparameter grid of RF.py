'''
In this exercise, you'll manually set the grid of hyperparameters that will be used to tune rf's hyperparameters and find the optimal regressor. For this purpose, you will be constructing a grid of hyperparameters and tune the number of estimators, the maximum number of features used when splitting each node and the minimum number of samples (or fraction) per leaf.

# Define the dictionary 'params_rf'
params_rf = {
    'n_estimators': [100, 350, 500],
    'max_features': ['log2', 'auto', 'sqrt'],
    'min_samples_leaf': [2, 10, 30],
}
