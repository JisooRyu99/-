'''
Finally, let's build a model using the text vector we created, desc_tfidf, using the filtered_words list to create a filtered text vector. Let's see if we can predict the type of the sighting based on the text. We'll use a Naive Bayes model for this.
'''

# Use the list of filtered words we created to filter the text vector
filtered_text = desc_tfidf[:, list(filtered_words)]

# Split the X and y sets using train_test_split, setting stratify=y 
train_X, test_X, train_y, test_y = train_test_split(filtered_text.toarray(), y, stratify=y)

# Fit nb to the training sets
nb.fit(train_X, train_y)

# Print the score of nb on the test sets
nb.score(test_X, test_y)
