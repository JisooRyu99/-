'''
The accuracy score on the unscaled wine dataset was decent, but we can likely do better if we scale the dataset. The process is mostly the same as the previous exercise, with the added step of scaling the data. Once again, the knn model as well as the X and y data and labels set have already been created for you.
'''

# Create the scaling method.
ss = StandardScaler()

# Apply the scaling method to the dataset used for modeling.
X_scaled = ss.fit_transform(X)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_scaled, y)

# Fit the k-nearest neighbors model to the training data.
knn.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Score the model on the test data.
print(knn.score(X_test, y_test))
