'''
Since we know that the Ash, Alcalinity of ash, and Magnesium columns in the wine dataset are all on different scales, let's standardize them in a way that allows for use in a linear model.
'''

# Import StandardScaler from scikit-learn
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Create the scaler
ss = StandardScaler()

# Take a subset of the DataFrame you want to scale 
wine_subset = wine[['Ash', 'Alcalinity of ash', 'Magnesium']]

# Apply the scaler to the DataFrame subset
wine_subset_scaled = ss.fit_transform(wine_subset)
