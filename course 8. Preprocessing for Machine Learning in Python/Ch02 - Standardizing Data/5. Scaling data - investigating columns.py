We want to use the Ash, Alcalinity of ash, and Magnesium columns in the wine dataset to train a linear model, but it's possible that these columns are all measured in different ways, which would bias a linear model. Using describe() to return descriptive statistics about this dataset, which of the following statements are true about the scale of data in these columns?
'''

Possible Answers = 4

1. The max of Ash is 3.23, the max of Alcalinity of ash is 30, and the max of Magnesium is 162.

2. The means of Ash and Alcalinity of ash are less than 20, while the mean of Magnesium is greater than 90.

3. The standard deviations of Ash and Alcalinity of ash are equal.

4. 1 and 2 are true.
