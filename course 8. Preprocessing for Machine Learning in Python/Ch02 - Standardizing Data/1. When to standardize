Now that you've learned when it is appropriate to standardize your data, which of these scenarios would you NOT want to standardize?

Possible Answers = 4

1. A column you want to use for modeling has extremely high variance.

2. You have a dataset with several continuous columns on different scales and you'd like to use a linear model to train the data.

3. The models you're working with use some sort of distance metric in a linear space, like the Euclidean metric.

4. Your dataset is comprised of categorical data.
