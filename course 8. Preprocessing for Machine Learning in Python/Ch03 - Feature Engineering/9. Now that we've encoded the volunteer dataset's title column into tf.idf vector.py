'''
Now that we've encoded the volunteer dataset's title column into tf/idf vectors, let's use those vectors to try to predict the category_desc column.
'''

# Split the dataset according to the class distribution of category_desc
y = volunteer["category_desc"]
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(text_tfidf.toarray(), y, stratify=y)

# Fit the model to the training data
nb.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Print out the model's accuracy
print(nb.score(X_test, y_test))
