'''
Now that we have run PCA on the wine dataset, let's try training a model with it.
'''

# Split the transformed X and the y labels into training and test sets
X_wine_train, X_wine_test, y_wine_train, y_wine_test = train_test_split(transformed_X, y)

# Fit knn to the training data
knn.fit(X_wine_train, y_wine_train)

# Score knn on the test data and print it out
knn.score(X_wine_test, y_wine_test)
