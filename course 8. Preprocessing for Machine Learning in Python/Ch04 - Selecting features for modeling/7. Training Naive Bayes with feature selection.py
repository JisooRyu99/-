'''
Let's re-run the Naive Bayes text classification model we ran at the end of chapter 3, with our selection choices from the previous exercise, on the volunteer dataset's title and category_desc columns.
'''

# Split the dataset according to the class distribution of category_desc, using the filtered_text vector
train_X, test_X, train_y, test_y = train_test_split(filtered_text.toarray(), y, stratify=y)

# Fit the model to the training data
nb.fit(train_X, train_y)

# Print out the model's accuracy
print(nb.score(test_X, test_y))
