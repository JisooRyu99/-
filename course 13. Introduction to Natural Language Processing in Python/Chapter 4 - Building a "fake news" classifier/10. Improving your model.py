'''
Your job in this exercise is to test a few different alpha levels using the Tfidf vectors to determine if there is a better performing combination.

The training and test sets have been created, and tfidf_vectorizer, tfidf_train, and tfidf_test have been computed.
'''

# Create the list of alphas: alphas
alphas = np.arange(0,1,0.1)

# Define train_and_predict()
def train_and_predict(alpha):
    # Instantiate the classifier: nb_classifier
    nb_classifier = MultinomialNB(alpha=alpha)
    # Fit to the training data
    nb_classifier.fit(tfidf_train,y_train)
    # Predict the labels: pred
    pred =  nb_classifier.predict(tfidf_test)
    # Compute accuracy: score
    score = metrics.accuracy_score(y_test,pred)
    return score

# Iterate over the alphas and print the corresponding score
for alpha in alphas:
    print('Alpha: ', alpha)
    print('Score: ', train_and_predict(alpha))
    print()
