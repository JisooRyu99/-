'''
You recently created a simple random forest model to predict Tic-Tac-Toe game wins for your boss, and at her request, you did not do any parameter tuning. Unfortunately, the overall model accuracy was too low for her standards. This time around, she has asked you to focus on model performance.

Before you start testing different models and parameter sets, you will need to split the data into training, validation, and testing datasets. Remember that after splitting the data into training and testing datasets, the validation dataset is created by splitting the training dataset.

The datasets X and y have been loaded for your use.

# Create temporary training and final testing datasets
X_temp, X_test, y_temp, y_test  =\
    train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=1111)

# Create the final training and validation datasets
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val =\
    train_test_split(X_temp, y_temp, test_size=0.25, random_state=1111)
