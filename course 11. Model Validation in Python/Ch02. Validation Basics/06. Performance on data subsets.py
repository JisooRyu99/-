'''
In professional basketball, there are two conferences, the East and the West. Coaches and fans often only care about how teams in their own conference will do this year.

You have been working on an NBA prediction model and would like to determine if the predictions were better for the East or West conference. You added a third array to your data called labels, which contains an "E" for the East teams, and a "W" for the West. y_test and predictions have again been loaded for your use.
'''

# Find the East conference teams
east_teams = labels == "E"

# Create arrays for the true and predicted values
true_east = y_test[east_teams]
preds_east = predictions[east_teams]

# Print the accuracy metrics
print('The MAE for East teams is {}'.format(
    mae(true_east, preds_east)))

# Print the West accuracy
print('The MAE for West conference is {}'.format(west_error))
