'''
Predictive tasks fall into one of two categories: regression or classification. In the candy dataset, the outcome is a continuous variable describing how often the candy was chosen over another candy in a series of 1-on-1 match-ups. To predict this value (the win-percentage), you will use a regression model.

In this exercise, you will specify a few parameters using a random forest regression model rfr.
'''

# Set the number of trees
rfr.n_estimators = 100

# Add a maximum depth
rfr.max_depth = 6

# Set the random state
rfr.random_state = 1111

# Fit the model
rfr.fit(X_train, y_train)
