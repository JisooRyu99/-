'''
Last semester your professor challenged your class to build a predictive model to predict final exam test scores. You tried running a few different models by randomly selecting hyperparameters. However, running each model required you to code it individually.

After learning about RandomizedSearchCV(), you're revisiting your professors challenge to build the best model. In this exercise, you will prepare the three necessary inputs for completing a random search.

# Create a random forest regression model

# Create a scorer to use (use the mean squared error)
scorer = make_scorer(mean_squared_error)
