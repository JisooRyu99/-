'''
You have already created splits, which contains indices for the candy-data dataset to complete 5-fold cross-validation. To get a better estimate for how well a colleague's random forest model will perform on a new data, you want to run this model on the five different training and validation indices you just created.

In this exercise, you will use these indices to check the accuracy of this model using the five different splits. A for loop has been provided to assist with this process.
