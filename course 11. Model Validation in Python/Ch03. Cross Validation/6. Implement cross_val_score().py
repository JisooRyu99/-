'''
Your company has created several new candies to sell, but they are not sure if they should release all five of them. To predict the popularity of these new candies, you have been asked to build a regression model using the candy dataset. Remember that the response value is a head-to-head win-percentage against other candies.

Before you begin trying different regression models, you have decided to run cross-validation on a simple random forest model to get a baseline error to compare with any future results.

rfc = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=25, random_state=1111)
mse = make_scorer(mean_squared_error)

# Set up cross_val_score
cv = cross_val_score(estimator=rfc,
                     X=X_train,
                     y=y_train,
                     cv=10,
                     scoring=mse)

# Print the mean error
print(cv.mean())
